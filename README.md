# Smart-Frame Implementation with WebDriverIO

An implementation of the `smart-frame` attribute that cannot be done with Cypress. In the search for a tool, WebDriverIO turned out to be the best, so I decided to use it in practice.

## How to Run

To run the tests with WebDriverIO, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

2. Run the tests:

    ```
    npx wdio run test/wdio.conf.ts
    ```
